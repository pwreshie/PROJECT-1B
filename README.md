# PROJECT-1B
A dataset on an e-commerce was provided, where I performed data mining in order to extract a particular feature.
The extracted feature was what I basically worked on, where;
I used Line graph, Bar chart, & Pie chart to show Visualizations which was required.
I applied Statistical concepts to find if certian outcomes have effects on outcome of different features, here; I used Chi-square.
Basic analysis were also being carried out on the extracted data e.g: Find the peak period and the State(s) that had most impact.
